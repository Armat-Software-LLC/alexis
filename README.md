# IMPORTANT

This repository will contain multiple projects. Because of this, this respository will have a folder for each homework/assignment.

It is important to remember that
- You will work with GIt on the root folder level as this is a single repository
- You will work with each assignment only in individual subfolder, in isolation from everything else under the repository


# ASSIGNMENTS

## HW2

|IP|Host|
|---|---|
|127.0.0.1|server.local|
|127.0.0.1|badguy.local|
|127.0.0.1|goodguy.local|

make sure to restore and install all python requirements

if everything works, you should be able to run three web sites and see the web pages.

Try to apply CORS restrictions and test with good and bad guy sites. CORS policy is alread enforced, just try to restrict it to one or the other guy and see what happens

Focus on CSP policy - try to apply different CSP headers. For example, set default to 'none' and see what happens. Try to research and explain the results.

You are still recovering from being sick, so I'm not really pushing on achieving certain goals, but spend some time to understand the script, what it does, and how you can test different scenarios with CORS and CSP policies.

Write down all questions and we will discuss in the next call. your goal is to have 10 questions for me.
